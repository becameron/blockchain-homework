# Canadian Blockchain Case Study: Blockstream
## What is it
Blockstream is a Canadian blockchain company that uses the Bitcoin ecosystem and protocol to create distributed financial infrastructure. The company aims to make financial markets more efficient by reducing counterparty risk through secure blockchain in peer-to-peer transactions. The company is also involved in furthering Bitcoin blockchain technological development.

In recent years, Blockstream has focused on developing Bitcoin sidechains and other blockchain-related applications. Their most recent innovation is a proposed new way of transferring ledgered assets across multiple block chains. These customized chains would be pegged to bitcoinâ€™s blockchain.

Blockstream also aims to make Bitcoing transaction times instanenous using a lightning network, which acts as a second layer payment protocol ontop of the existing bitcoin blockchain.

Invests heavily in research and development to further strengthen security.

## Why this Matters
Despite its wide adoption and popularity, Bitcoin faces a number of technical issues related to scalability. Bitcoin's original blocks are limited to 1 megabyte in size. This limits the number of transactions that the network can process, reduces transaction speeds, and increases transaction fees.

There are a number of approaches to managing the old core technology of Bitcoin, including hard/soft forks, side chains and slide chains. Blockstream's core development team boasts many high-profile developers aimed at furthering Bitcoin's blockchain technology. 

While their end-goal is to build a subscription-based blockchain service for industries, the Bitcoin community benefits from the company's developments.
